3) Props for star rating component[3]

<StarRatingComponent
    name={String} /* name of the radio input, it is required */
    value={Number} /* number of selected icon (`0` - none, `1` - first) */
    starCount={Number} /* number of icons in rating, default `5` */
    onStarClick={Function(nextValue, prevValue, name)} /* on icon click handler */
    onStarHover={Function(nextValue, prevValue, name)} /* on icon hover handler */
    onStarHoverOut={Function(nextValue, prevValue, name)} /* on icon hover out handler */

    emptyStarColor={String} /* color of non-selected icons, default `#333` */
    editing={Boolean} /* is component available for editing, default `true` */
/>

4) HTML5 and CSS3

5) MERN (MongoDB, express, React, NodeJs) framework
   We are using MERN stack for our website development. React renders and returns the HTML code. The components are developed using HTML, CSS, react-bootstrap, and JavaScript.
   It uses React router to load different components according to user requests. NodeJs and express are used to set up the backend for Haul Share.
   Express.js is used for developing NodeJs applications. Express is used to respond to HTTP requests. MongoDB is used for storing the data in JSON format.
   MongoDB is used because it is schemaless. Both structured and unstructured data can be stored easily.    


6 W3C compliant
  We have used React for front-end development which is totally w3c compliant.

7. Code Modification
============================================================================================================================================

In this feature I am just using GET request. So, I have not taken code from any website for refernce. And because of there is not code in my part which is modified.

============================================================================================================================================
7. Important Note
============================================================================================================================================

I have implemented my feature in my group website. But my feature is dependent upon my groupmate Anuj Sharma’s feature. 
My feature is to fetch data when the user clicks the “Click here for vehicle details” from the “Trip” card. 
My feature is bounded in the card which was developed by my other groupmate. For making my feature dynamic he needed some changes
in the design of the card and also in his features. So, in my own branch it is not developed static only but from Heroku link 
one can check its dynamic implementation. Moreover, you can find comments only in my own branch.

--> For specific my feature
use haul-share-project/KushalB00824760  link

--> It is also working in Heroku link dynamically
use https://haul-share-official.herokuapp.com/

My second feature is left, which will be implemented for the final project after this submission.
