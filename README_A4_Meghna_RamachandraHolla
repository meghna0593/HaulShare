######Installation and Setup######

I. Project link to GitLab
https://git.cs.dal.ca/holla/haul-share-project [27]

II. Project Setup on the local system from GitLab
1. Clone project from gitlab.cs.dal.ca
2. Go to the directory 'Haul-Share-Project_Group5' on the terminal/console
3. Run 'npm install' on the terminal  (Install node[29] and npm[30] before this step)
4. After the installation, run 'npm start' on the terminal. The server files need not be explicitly run as they are concurrently[] run with front end. 
5. A browser will open locally and run the application on 'localhost:3000' (The port might change depending on the applications running on the user's browser)

III. Project link on Heroku:
https://haulshare.herokuapp.com/ [1]

IV. Link to pages for the application running on Heroku
Create Ad Page - https://haulshare.herokuapp.com/post-ad 

IV. Features and Files worked on:
1. The feature I worked on is 'Posting Advertisement'. 
2. I have written a 'postAnAd' POST method to create new documents on MongoDB. 
3. I have written a 'getUname' GET/id method to get a particular user based on ID passed.
2. The files I worked on are 'server_m.js'(backend) and 'create-ad.js' (frontend) 
3. The implementation of the feature is inline with the initial design specification.

V. Technologies Used
The framework used for front-end development is ReactJS. Therefore, NodeJS with Express is used for developing the backend services.
The database used is MongoDB. MongoClient is used to make connection with the database.
MongoDB Atlas is used as it is a cloud database service and can be easily accessed by all Haul-Share developers. 

######Login Details######
Either register with the system and then login using those credentials, or use the login details given below.
Username: haul@share.com

######Project Folder Structure######
The Project folders have been structured to suit their needs. Modular style is followed to structure the files.
All the front-end related files are in 'src/components' folder. 
Every ReactJS component that represents a different page has been put in a separate folder inside 'components' folder. This folder consists of its respective css and js file.
All the images are included in a common folder i.e., 'public/images'
All the back-end related files are in 'src/server' folder.
The folder 'util' has Routes file.

######Additional Changes on User Interface######
1. The 'post-ad' page has been improvised further.
2. Proper recovery messages added for front-end and back-end errors.
3. Autocomplete on Location Search is added.
4. Validations on Date based on current date is added.
5. Validation on Location has changed based on another feature(maps).

######Compatiblility######
The application is compatible with different browsers like Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, FireFox.
The application is responsive. It can be viewed on phones(screen width upto 480px), tablets (screen width from 480px-1024px) and large screens(screen width greater than 1024px)
The application is w3C Compliant
