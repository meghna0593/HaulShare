**Front-End Frameworks:**
    In our application, we have used React.js. React is a javascript library for building user-interfaces. It deals with the view component of the MVC framework.React allows developers to reuse the components.With React, creating dynamic web applications becomes easier.

 *Packages:*
     The application used below packages.
     1.npm react-datepicker
     2.react-bootstrap
     3.react-router

**Colour schemes:**
     My application has Eden(#34675C) color as the major element. The color was inspired by referring canva.com (Dmitry,& Nikolaev).I chose this color to give a bold look to the application.
